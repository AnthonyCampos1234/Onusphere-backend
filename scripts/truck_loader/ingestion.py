    prompt = """You are given the raw extracted text from a PDF that contains information about product shipping, handling requirements, and customer order details.

                Your task is to carefully read through the text and extract the following information:

                1. Special Handling Instructions:
                - Extract all special handling instructions related to specific items.
                - Return them as a JSON array where each object contains:
                    - "item_id" (string): the item number mentioned in the instruction.
                    - "instruction" (string): the full text of the instruction that applies to that item.
                - If an instruction applies to multiple items, include a separate object for each item with the same instruction.

                2. Order Metadata:
                - Extract the "date_ordered" from the document. It should be the date the order was created or acknowledged (usually near "Ack Date" or at the top of the document).
                - Extract the "customer_id", which is the name of the customer receiving the shipment (found in the "Ship To" section). Use the full customer name string as it appears.

                Important rules:
                - Only include items that are explicitly mentioned inside special handling instructions (like stacking restrictions, oversized warnings, etc).
                - Ignore general order information, addresses, or contacts not tied to specific item handling.
                - Extract exactly the item IDs as they appear (usually 8-digit numbers).
                - Format your final output strictly as a clean JSON object.

                Final JSON output format:

                {
                "date_ordered": "MM/DD/YY",
                "customer_id": "Customer Name",
                "special_instructions": [
                    {
                    "item_id": "ItemNumber1",

                    "item_id": "ItemNumber2",
